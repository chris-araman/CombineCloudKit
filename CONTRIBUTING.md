## 🧑🏽‍💻👩🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻 Pull Requests

I welcome high quality pull requests from everyone! 🦄

Pull requests are preferred over bug reports and feature requests. ✨

Submit [pull requests](https://github.com/chris-araman/CombineCloudKit/compare) from your fork of the repository. I may
suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. To increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Ensure your changes build, test, and lint successfully.

- Write tests for any new functionality and backfill tests to improve code coverage.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.

### 🛠 Building CombineCloudKit

Use the Swift Package Manager to build:

### ✅ Testing CombineCloudKit

Unit testing is accomplished using mock CloudKit types.

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/chris-araman/CombineCloudKit/main?style=flat-square&color=informational)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/chris-araman/CombineCloudKit/)

> 🚧 Integration testing against the CloudKit API and service will require app entitlements. Some work
> remains to wire this up automatically to `swift test`.

Use the Swift Package Manager to test:

```bash
swift test
```

### 🧹 Linting CombineCloudKit

We check for lint using several tools, many of which are installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Please fix any
issues reported here before submitting a pull request.

public types or functions using
[markup](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/) with
appropriate [syntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/DocumentationComments.md).

Generate new documentation pages:
